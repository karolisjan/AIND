## Term 1 projects
<a id='build_a_sign_language_recognizer'></a>
### [Build a Sign Language Recognizer](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-1/sign_recognizer)
Built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). Trained a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video to try and identify individual words from test sequences. Experimented with model selection techniques including BIC, DIC, and K-fold Cross Validation.

**Keywords:** *Probabilistic Graphical Models, Model Selection*

<a id='implement_a_planning_search'></a>
### [Implement a Planning Search](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-1/planning)
Used logic and planning techniques to create an AI that finds the most efficient route to route cargo around the world to their respective destinations. This project used a combination of propositional logic and search along with A* heuristics to find optimal planning solutions.

**Keywords:** *Logic, Planning, Search*

<a id='build_a_game_playing_ai'></a>
### [Build a Game-Playing Agent](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-1/isolation)
Created an AI that beats human opponents in the game of Isolation using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Search, and Iterative Deepening.

**Keywords:** *Game Playing, Search*

<a id='creating_an_ai_agent_to_solve_sudoku'></a>
### [Creating an AI Agent to solve Sudoku](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-1/sudoku)
Created an AI to solve Diagonal Sudokus using constraint propagation and search techniques. Additionally, taught the agent to use the Naked Twins advanced Sudoku strategy.

**Keywords:** *Constraint Propagation, Search*

## Term 2 projects
<a id='keras_mini_project'></a>
### [Using Keras for Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-2/mini_projects_w_Keras)
Analysed a dataset of 50,000 movie reviews from IMDB and used it to predict the sentiment of a review.

**Keywords:** *Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Processing, Neural Networks*
