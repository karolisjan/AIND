# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree (2017)
Projects developed during Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree.

## Term 1 projects
### [Build a Sign Language Recognizer](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-1/sign_recognizer)
Built a system that can recognize words communicated using the American Sign Language (ASL). Trained a set of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) using part of a preprocessed dataset of tracked hand and nose positions extracted from video to try and identify individual words from test sequences. Experimented with model selection techniques including BIC, DIC, and K-fold Cross Validation.

**Keywords:** *Probabilistic Graphical Models, Model Selection*

### [Implement a Planning Search](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-1/planning)
Used logic and planning techniques to create an AI that finds the most efficient route to route cargo around the world to their respective destinations. This project used a combination of propositional logic and search along with A* heuristics to find optimal planning solutions.

**Keywords:** *Logic, Planning, Search*

### [Build a Game-Playing Agent](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-1/isolation)
Created an AI that beats human opponents in the game of Isolation using Minimax, Alpha-Beta Search, and Iterative Deepening.

**Keywords:** *Game Playing, Search*

### [Creating an AI Agent to solve Sudoku](https://github.com/karolisjan/AIND/tree/master/Term-1/sudoku)
Created an AI to solve Diagonal Sudokus using constraint propagation and search techniques. Additionally, taught the agent to use the Naked Twins advanced Sudoku strategy.

**Keywords:** *Constraint Propagation, Search*
